# lark-codex-bridge

A local Feishu / Lark bot that forwards chat messages to your local Codex CLI. It is designed for people who already use Codex on their own machine and want to trigger the same local agent from Feishu or Lark chats.

[中文 README](./README.zh.md)

This project was adapted from the architecture of `zarazhangrui/feishu-claude-code-bridge`, with the agent layer replaced by Codex CLI and the local state directory renamed to `~/.feishu-codex-bridge`.

## Status

This is an open-source alpha extracted from a personal deployment. It is useful for personal or small-team use, but you should review the security model and access-control settings before inviting it into large groups.

It does not require an OpenAI API key or a Claude API key. Codex runs through your local Codex CLI login.

## Features

- Send Feishu / Lark messages to local `codex exec`.
- Keep separate Codex sessions per chat or topic.
- Stream replies as lightweight markdown cards or send one final text reply.
- Use `/new [name]` to create a new group chat and inherit the current workspace.
- Use `/reset` to clear the current chat session.
- Switch and save workspaces with `/cd` and `/ws`.
- Download images and files from chat and pass their local paths to Codex.
- Configure access control, reply mode, concurrency, run idle timeout, and Codex reasoning effort from `/config`.
- Run in the foreground or as an OS-managed background process.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- A working local Codex CLI login. Run `codex login` in your normal terminal first.
- A Feishu / Lark PersonalAgent app.
- Network access to OpenAI/Codex and Feishu/Lark open platform endpoints.

The first run can guide you through app registration by QR code. `lark-cli` is optional but recommended; the bridge uses it so Codex can call Feishu/Lark APIs from local tool runs.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
npm i -g @vicluo/lark-codex-bridge
lark-codex-bridge --version
```

From source:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm build
node bin/lark-codex-bridge.mjs --help
```

## First Run

Run the bridge in the foreground:

```bash
lark-codex-bridge run
```

Or from a source checkout:

```bash
node bin/lark-codex-bridge.mjs run
```

On first run the bridge creates `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/config.json`. If no app credentials are present, it starts the QR-code registration wizard. Fresh App Secrets are moved into the encrypted local keystore at `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/secrets.enc`.

After the terminal says it is listening, DM the bot:

```text
/status
Reply exactly OK
```

## Feishu / Lark App Settings

Confirm these in the open-platform console. Missing scopes or events are the most common reason the bridge connects but the bot stays silent.

Required permission scopes:

- `im:message`
- `im:message:send_as_bot`
- `im:resource`
- `im:chat`, required by `/new`
- `drive:drive`, required for cloud-doc comment handling

Required event subscriptions in long-connection mode:

- `im.message.receive_v1`
- `card.action.trigger`
- `drive.notice.comment_add_v1`, required for cloud-doc comments

Optional event subscriptions:

- `im.message.reaction.created_v1`
- `im.message.reaction.deleted_v1`
- `im.chat.member.bot.added_v1`

## Host CLI

Foreground process commands:

```bash
lark-codex-bridge run [-c <config>]
lark-codex-bridge ps
lark-codex-bridge kill <id|#>
```

Background service commands:

```bash
lark-codex-bridge start
lark-codex-bridge stop
lark-codex-bridge restart
lark-codex-bridge status
lark-codex-bridge unregister
```

Service backends:

- macOS: user `launchd` agent with `KeepAlive`.
- Linux: user `systemd` unit with `Restart=always`.
- Windows: Task Scheduler task plus a `.cmd` launcher that restarts crashed bridge runs after 60 seconds. A clean exit is not restarted.

Do not start two bridge processes for the same Feishu/Lark app. Open-platform long-connection events may be delivered to either process at random.

## Slash Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/new [name]` | Create a new group chat, start a fresh session, inherit current cwd, invite sender |
| `/reset` | Clear the current chat session |
| `/resume [N]` | List recent Codex sessions for the current cwd |
| `/cd <path>` | Switch cwd within `FEISHU_CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` and reset session |
| `/ws list/save/use/remove` | Manage named workspaces |
| `/status` | Show current scope, cwd, session, agent, and reasoning setting |
| `/config` | Configure reply mode, tool display, concurrency, timeout, reasoning effort, and access control |
| `/timeout [N\|off\|default]` | Override idle timeout for the current session |
| `/stop` | Stop the current Codex run |
| `/ps` | List bridge processes on this host |
| `/exit <id\|#>` | Stop one bridge process |
| `/reconnect` | Force a Feishu/Lark WebSocket reconnect |
| `/doctor [description]` | Ask Codex to diagnose recent bridge logs |
| `/account` | View or rotate app credentials |
| `/help` | Show the help card |

In DMs, the bot responds to normal messages. In groups and topic groups, the default is to respond only when the bot is mentioned.

## Configuration

Local state lives outside the repository:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/config.json` | App config and preferences |
| `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/secrets.enc` | Encrypted App Secret store |
| `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/sessions.json` | Chat/topic to Codex session mapping |
| `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/workspaces.json` | Named workspaces |
| `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/processes.json` | Live process registry |
| `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/media/<chatId>/` | Downloaded attachment cache |
| `~/.feishu-codex-bridge/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log` | Structured JSONL logs |

Important environment variables:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CODEX_HOME` | Codex config directory. If unset, Codex CLI uses its own default. |
| `CODEX_BIN` | Custom Codex executable path. |
| `FEISHU_CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Maximum filesystem root the bot may use for `/cd` and default cwd. Defaults to the process cwd. |
| `FEISHU_CODEX_BRIDGE_PROXY` | Optional proxy used by the Windows helper script. |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` | Optional network proxy inherited by Node and Codex child processes. |

### Sandbox Escape Approval

When `/config` sets `Codex file permission` to `acceptEdits`, Codex runs in
`workspace-write`: it can edit the current workspace, but writes outside the
workspace still fail in the Codex sandbox. If a command fails with a sandbox-like
permission error, the bridge sends an approval card to the same chat.

Only `/config` admins may click **Allow once**. After approval, the bridge runs
the exact failed shell command on the host, outside the Codex sandbox, then
queues the command result back into the same Codex session as a follow-up
message. The host-side execution has a 30-minute timeout. The approval is
one-time and expires from memory; it is not persisted across bridge restarts.

## Security Notes

- Never commit App Secret, OpenAI/Codex login state, cookies, or `~/.feishu-codex-bridge`.
- Restrict `FEISHU_CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to the smallest directory tree the bot should access.
- Set `/config` admins before inviting the bot into shared groups.
- In groups, keep "require mention" enabled unless you deliberately want all group messages sent to Codex.
- Treat sandbox escape approvals as local shell access. Only approve commands
  you recognize and only in trusted chats.
- `/doctor` sanitizes logs before sending them to Codex, but logs may still contain operational metadata. Use it in trusted chats.

## Development

```bash
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm build
git diff --check
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the same typecheck, test, and build checks on pull requests.
